ðŸ‘‹ I recently joined GenBio.ai as a research scientist. Before that, I completed my PhD in machine learning and computational biology under the joint supervision of Laura Cantini at Institut Pasteur and Gabriel PeyrÃ© at ENS PSL. My research focused on leveraging optimal transport techniques for analyzing single-cell multiomics data, bridging the fields of machine learning and genomics.
