ðŸ‘‹ I recently completed my PhD in machine learning and computational biology (September 2024) under the joint supervision of Laura Cantini at Institut Pasteur and Gabriel PeyrÃ© at ENS PSL. My research focused on leveraging optimal transport techniques for analyzing single-cell multiomics data, bridging the fields of machine learning and genomics. I am now seeking research scientist or postdoctoral opportunities where I can apply my expertise in machine learning to advance genomics and computational biology.
